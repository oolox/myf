MYF-TB-PB2XL
</br></br>
This item is like the standard PB2 turnbuckle. The eye threading is #4-40 and the shackle uses a # 2-56 hex bolt, however the threaded length is 1 1/4" minimum. This allows for more adjustment, and less chance of becoming undone due to high vibration during sailing.
</br></br>
The cost for this item ( PN: MYF-TB-PB2-XL) is $16.50 each.
</br>
The added cost is due to more material and more complicitaed machining.
